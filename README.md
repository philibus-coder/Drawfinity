modular gridfinity drawer

BOM:
-5mm MDF
-40mmx20mm pine
-16mm PVC pipe
-20mmx4.5mm flathead woodscrews
-m3 threaded inserts
-m3 10mm screws




20mmx40mm pine for the brackets. cut to desired length with 90 Degree cuts use  jig for more consistent results.

for the slides i used 5mm MDF sealed with zeisser B.I.N; as a more Budget option I would recommend a 1:1 Wood glue/water mix. I used a router+Pattern router bit+jig for cutting multiple slides at a time but anything goes.

used some PTFE tape underneath the slides for less friction

check your tolerances with the pipes before printing everything.

Assembly: 
-first brackets must be measured to pipes, from Bottom up. 
-to lock them in place i used threaded inserts in the Corner brackets and m3 screws 
-use the pipe jigs for easy assembly
-everything else should be explained by Looking at photos

construction principles TLDR: vertical load on pipes, shear forces are distributed to every wood frame individually, printed parts have little to no strain vertical to layer lines. The printed bushings connected to the pipes, help to align and stabilize the pipes which makes the structure very stable, yet flexible. The friction between printed corner brackets and PVC pipe help maintain structural integrity between layer lines where Fdm printed parts are weakest. Long handle to Prevent open MDF side from drooping over time.
